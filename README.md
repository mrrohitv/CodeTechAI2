Project Title: Tic-Tac-Toe AI Documentation

Introduction:
This documentation provides a comprehensive guide to understanding and utilizing an AI agent that plays the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe against a human player. The AI player is implemented using the Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning to ensure it makes optimal moves and remains unbeatable. This project aims to demonstrate game theory principles and basic search algorithms.
1. Overview:
The Tic-Tac-Toe AI project implements an AI player that competes against a human player in the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe. The AI player is designed to make optimal moves using the Minimax algorithm, which is enhanced with Alpha-Beta Pruning to improve efficiency and reduce search space.

2. Installation:
There is no specific installation required for the Tic-Tac-Toe AI project as it's implemented in a programming language such as Python. Users need to have Python installed on their system to run the project.

3. Usage:
Users can interact with the Tic-Tac-Toe AI by running the provided Python script. Upon execution, the game will prompt the user to make moves against the AI player. The AI player will then make its moves based on the Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning.

4. Code Explanation:
The code for the Tic-Tac-Toe AI project typically consists of the following components:

Game Board Representation: This involves representing the Tic-Tac-Toe board and tracking player moves.
AI Player: This involves implementing the AI player using the Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning to determine optimal moves.

5. Conclusion:
The Tic-Tac-Toe AI project demonstrates the implementation of an AI player using the Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning to play the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe against human players. By making optimal moves, the AI player remains unbeatable, providing a challenging opponent for players. This project serves as a valuable learning tool for understanding game theory principles and
